# text-me-later

## Description

This app is a single-page application that meets PWA criteria. When used, it allows clients to type code on their browser and it is saved and reloaded upon refresh. The name "Text Me Later" is inspired by the fact that it is available to be installed and used offline!

## Installation

After forking the GitHub Repo (https://github.com/jaolsen7/text-me-later), users will need NodeJS and the required npm packages. Note: the package.json is different for the root, client, server. I advise to open the Integrated Terminal of VSCode into the server directory. Run "npm i", then once done, run "cd .." and "npm i" again which will run the root and then the client. Once finished, you can open the app using "npm run start" or for development "npm run start:dev". See the package.json scripts for more.

## Usage

You will be prompted to access [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), where you can begin typing and refreshing without lost data, or installing and working offline! You may need to Clear Site Data in the Application section of Dev Tools.
